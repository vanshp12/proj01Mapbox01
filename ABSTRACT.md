ABSTRACT

Navigation and route planning have become indispensable tools for modern travelers and commuters, yet the current ecosystem often forces users to rely on disjointed solutions for different needs such as routing, point-of-interest discovery, and trip tracking. Many existing applications focus solely on getting from point A to point B, disregarding the holistic travel experience that includes discovering amenities, managing offline resources, and analyzing travel behavior. This fragmentation leads to a subpar user experience and inefficient travel planning.

YatraSahayata is developed as a comprehensive solution to these challenges, offering a unified platform that integrates professional-grade navigation, intelligent discovery features, and robust trip management into a single Android application. It empowers users to seamlessly plan routes, find essential services like restaurants and fuel stations, and maintain a detailed history of their journeys without switching between multiple apps.

The system is built as a native Android application, leveraging the power of Mapbox SDKs for high-precision mapping, search, and navigation capabilities. The application utilizes a layered architecture where the frontend provides an intuitive, Material Design-based interface, and the data layer efficiently manages local persistence using the Room Database. This ensures that features like saved places and trip history are available instantly and securely on the device, while complex routing and geocoding tasks are handled by Mapbox’s robust cloud infrastructure.

This project demonstrates the effective application of modern mobile development practices and third-party API integration to solve real-world navigation problems. YatraSahayata stands out as a user-centric tool that not only provides accurate directions but also enhances the overall travel experience through its focus on usability, offline accessibility, and comprehensive feature integration.
