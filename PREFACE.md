PREFACE

This project is entitled "YatraSahayata - Transforming Navigation Through Technology" and has been conducted in accordance with the Final Year Computer Science course, in partial completion of the condition to award the undergraduate degree. The given project can be viewed as the practical implementation of the theoretical knowledge received during the course, especially as far as software engineering, mobile app creation, geospatial technologies, and database management are concerned.

The reason why this project was chosen is due to the fragmented nature of current navigation solutions for travelers and daily commuters. Although basic routing applications are widely available, users often struggle with disjointed experiences where they must switch between multiple apps for navigation, point-of-interest discovery, and trip tracking. YatraSahayata is designed to deal with this gap by offering a convenient application that includes real-time turn-by-turn navigation, intelligent restaurant discovery, as well as comprehensive trip statistics into one application.

The following report captures the entire development life of the YatraSahayata application such as problem identification, system analysis, design decisions, technology selection, implementation and evaluation. A focus on constructing a functional, scalable, and maintainable system based on the contemporary development tools and frameworks like Mapbox SDKs and Android Jetpack components has been put forward. The back-end services leverage robust cloud-based location data processing, whereas the Android-based frontend has been developed with the usability and simplicity to the end users.

The effort that has gone into the work in this report is a genuine attempt to create a real-life application that is socially relevant, helping users navigate safely and efficiently, without compromising the academic standards and engineering best practices. The project has further assisted in the development of practical skills connected to application architecture, SDK integration, and the interface between backend location services and the frontend framework.
